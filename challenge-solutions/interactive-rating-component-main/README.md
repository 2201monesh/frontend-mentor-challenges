## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this frontend mentor challenge i created a interactive-rating-component-card, this challenge was really good and was helpful for me to revise properties like flexbox and some topics in javaScript.

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to to focus more on advance CSS properties like CSS Grid and much more and will try to solve those challenges to get hands-on experience on styling components.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me for revising flexbox concepts easily. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
